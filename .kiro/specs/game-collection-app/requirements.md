# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves transforming an existing virtual bookshelf application into a comprehensive game collection management system. The application will allow users to catalog, organize, and display their console and PC game collections with rich metadata including release dates, platforms, developers, and visual assets. The system will leverage a multi-tiered data acquisition strategy using Wikidata, Wikipedia, and strategic deep-linking to official stores for pricing information, as outlined in the Gemini research document.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game collector, I want to add games to my collection by searching for titles, so that I can build a comprehensive digital catalog of my physical and digital games.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a game title in the search interface THEN the system SHALL query Wikidata using SPARQL to retrieve structured game metadata
2. IF Wikidata returns incomplete data THEN the system SHALL fallback to Wikipedia's MediaWiki API to supplement missing information
3. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show game title, release date, platform, developer, and thumbnail image when available
4. WHEN a user selects a game from search results THEN the system SHALL add it to their collection with all retrieved metadata

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a game collector, I want to view my game collection in an organized visual format, so that I can easily browse and manage my games.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their collection THEN the system SHALL display games in a grid layout similar to the original bookshelf interface
2. WHEN displaying each game THEN the system SHALL show the game's cover art, title, platform, and release year
3. WHEN a user clicks on a game THEN the system SHALL display detailed information including developer, genre, and description when available
4. WHEN viewing the collection THEN the system SHALL support filtering by platform, genre, and release year
5. WHEN viewing the collection THEN the system SHALL support sorting by title, release date, or date added to collection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game collector, I want to access current pricing and purchase information for games, so that I can make informed decisions about acquiring new titles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing game details THEN the system SHALL display deep-link buttons to official store pages (Steam, PlayStation Store, Nintendo eShop, etc.)
2. WHEN a user clicks a store link THEN the system SHALL open the official store page in a new tab/window
3. WHEN displaying store links THEN the system SHALL only show links for platforms where the game is available
4. WHEN store information is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully hide store link buttons

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a game collector, I want to organize my games into custom categories or lists, so that I can group games by completion status, favorites, or other personal criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing a game in the collection THEN the system SHALL allow users to assign custom tags or categories
2. WHEN viewing the collection THEN the system SHALL support filtering by user-defined tags
3. WHEN a user creates a new tag THEN the system SHALL save it for future use across all games
4. WHEN displaying games THEN the system SHALL show assigned tags as visual indicators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a game collector, I want my collection data to persist between sessions, so that I don't lose my cataloged games when I close and reopen the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds or removes games THEN the system SHALL save changes to local storage immediately
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL restore the user's complete collection from local storage
3. WHEN collection data is corrupted or unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and allow starting fresh
4. WHEN exporting collection data THEN the system SHALL provide JSON format download for backup purposes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a game collector, I want the application to handle data retrieval failures gracefully, so that temporary network issues don't prevent me from using the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Wikidata queries fail THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt Wikipedia fallback without user intervention
2. WHEN both Wikidata and Wikipedia are unavailable THEN the system SHALL allow manual entry of basic game information
3. WHEN image loading fails THEN the system SHALL display a placeholder image with the game title
4. WHEN network requests timeout THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a game collector, I want proper attribution for data sources, so that the application complies with licensing requirements for Wikipedia content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying data sourced from Wikipedia THEN the system SHALL include attribution links to the source Wikipedia articles
2. WHEN showing game information THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate data sources (Wikidata, Wikipedia, or manual entry)
3. WHEN using Wikipedia content THEN the system SHALL comply with CC BY-SA licensing requirements
4. WHEN displaying attribution THEN the system SHALL make source links easily accessible but not intrusive to the user experience
